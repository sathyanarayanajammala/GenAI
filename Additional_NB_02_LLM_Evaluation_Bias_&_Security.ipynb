        "1. **Set Logging Level**: This line sets the `presidio-analyzer` logger to only display errors, reducing unnecessary logging information.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Initialize Anonymizer**: Creates a `PresidioReversibleAnonymizer` instance, specifying `analyzed_fields` (like `PERSON`, `PHONE_NUMBER`, etc.) to detect and anonymize. Setting `faker_seed=42` ensures reproducibility of fake data generated for anonymization.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Anonymize Data**: The `anonymize` method replaces sensitive information within the input text with fake data for the specified fields, such as names, phone numbers, and email addresses.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Display Result**: Prints the anonymized text, where sensitive details are replaced with placeholders, ensuring data privacy while retaining the text structure.\n",
